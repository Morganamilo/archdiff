archdiff
========

ArchDiff provides a way to see a "diff" for your entire [Arch
Linux][arch] system. This includes showing modified config files &
unpackaged files.

It's still a work in progress, and the goal is to enable an easy way
to keep manual modifications in check and compare/sync it against a
repository maintaing the changes independent of packages.

- "sync" intelligently based on timestamp
- force sync direction
- dry run mode
- interactive mode (view diffs as applied)
